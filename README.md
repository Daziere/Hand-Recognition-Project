# Hand-Recognition-Project
This git-hub is meant to give the code to create a hand recognition model which is created in 
the Final_Project_Hand_Rec file, and the Running_on_pi_notebook is the code used to run the
system on the pi. The Running_on_pi_notebook also has links on it in case there is issues in 
the set up of the raspberry pi.
